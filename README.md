- **Add missing, outdated, or clarifying  content**: If you want to add, remove, or expand on current content, please [submit an issue](https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-developer-docs/issues/new) before you start working on it. We will let you know if this is something that should be worked on, or not.
- Any contributions to the docs must follow our [Style guide](https://help.obsidian.md/Contributing+to+Obsidian/Style+guide).
