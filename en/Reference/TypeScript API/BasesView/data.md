[`BasesView`](BasesView) â€º [`data`](BasesView/data)

## BasesView.data property

The most recent output from executing the bases query, applying filters, and evaluating formulas. This object will be replaced with a new result set when changes to the vault or Bases config occur, so views should not keep a reference to it. Also note the contained BasesEntry objects will be recreated.

 1.10.0

**Signature:**

```typescript
data: BasesQueryResult;
```
