[`WorkspaceLeaf`](WorkspaceLeaf)

## WorkspaceLeaf class


**Signature:**

```typescript
export class WorkspaceLeaf extends WorkspaceItem 
```
**Extends:** [`WorkspaceItem`](WorkspaceItem)

## Properties

|  Property | Modifiers | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  [`isDeferred`](WorkspaceLeaf/isDeferred) | <code>readonly</code> | <code>boolean</code> | Returns true if this leaf is currently deferred because it is in the background. A deferred leaf will have a DeferredView as its view, instead of the View that it should normally have for its type (like MarkdownView for the <code>markdown</code> type).  1.7.2 |
|  [`parent`](WorkspaceLeaf/parent) |  | [`WorkspaceTabs`](WorkspaceTabs)<code> &#124; </code>[`WorkspaceMobileDrawer`](WorkspaceMobileDrawer) | <p>The direct parent of the leaf.</p><p>On desktop, a leaf is always a child of a <code>WorkspaceTabs</code> component. On mobile, a leaf might be a child of a <code>WorkspaceMobileDrawer</code>. Perform an <code>instanceof</code> check before making an assumption about the <code>parent</code>.</p> |
|  [`view`](WorkspaceLeaf/view) |  | [`View`](View) | The view associated with this leaf. Do not attempt to cast this to your custom <code>View</code> without first checking <code>instanceof</code>. |
