|  --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  [`hoverPopover`](WorkspaceLeaf/hoverPopover) |  | [`HoverPopover`](HoverPopover)<code> &#124; null</code> |  |
|  [`isDeferred`](WorkspaceLeaf/isDeferred) | <code>readonly</code> | <code>boolean</code> | Returns true if this leaf is currently deferred because it is in the background.

On mobile, a leaf might be a child of a <code>WorkspaceMobileDrawer</code>. Perform an <code>instanceof</code> check before making an assumption about the <code>parent</code>.</p> |
|  [`view`](WorkspaceLeaf/view) |  | [`View`](View) | The view associated with this leaf. Do not attempt to cast this to your custom <code>View</code> without first checking <code>instanceof</code>. |
