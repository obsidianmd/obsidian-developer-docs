## Command.hotkeys property

Sets the default hotkey. It is recommended for plugins to avoid setting default hotkeys if possible, to avoid conflicting hotkeys with one that's set by the user, even though customized hotkeys have higher priority.

**Signature:**

```typescript
hotkeys?: Hotkey[];
```
