### Introduction

Many of the [[CSS variables]] utilised in the Obsidian app can also be employed in Obsidian Publish (Publish), with corresponding selectors. However, to address to the differing requirements of Publish, the variables in this section were specifically created for Publish, and are to be inserted within the `.published-container` selector. 

See [[Build a Publish theme]] for more details.
