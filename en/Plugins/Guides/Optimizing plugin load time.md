In [Obsidian v1.7.1](https://obsidian.md/changelog/2024-08-27-desktop-v1.7.1/), we added the "Debug startup time" view. This view indicates how long it takes for the app to launch.

Plugins play an important rule in app load time. To ensure that Obsidian behaves correctly, Obsidian loads all plugins before the user can interact with the app.

### How do I improve my plugin's load time?

- Simplify your plugin `onload`.
- Check your plugin View constructor.
- Avoid the [common pitfalls](#Pitfalls).

First, the easy stuff. Make sure that you are using a production build of your plugin. If you are using a bundler like esbuild, rollup, or webpack, you can likely create a "development" build or a "production" build. A production build will usually be smaller, load faster, and remove code that's only used for testing. When you create a release, ensure that the `main.js` file is a production build.

In your build configuration, you should consider minifying your plugin code. This will make the overall plugin file size smaller and therefore faster for plugin to read from disk and load.

Next, make sure you aren't doing anything expensive inside your plugin's `onload` function. The `onload` function should only include code necessary for the plugin to initialize. This includes app registrations, like registering commands, view types, and Markdown post-processors. It should not include anything computationally expensive or data fetching.

If your plugin creates any custom views, be mindful of your custom view constructor. When Obsidian opens, it will reopen all the views saved to the user's workspace. If your view is loaded (and not [[Understanding deferred views|deferred]]), this will directly impact the app load time.

### If you have code that you want to run at startup, where should it go?

For most cases, you will want to wrap your code inside a `onLayoutReady` callback. These callbacks are deferred and are only called after Obsidian finishes loading.

## Pitfalls

### Listening to `vault.on('create')`

As a part of Obsidian's vault initialization process, it will call `create` for every file. If your plugin needs to react to new files getting created, you need to wait for the workspace to be ready first. Your vault event registration should be inside an `onLayoutReady` callback; this will ensure you don't start reacting to events until the workspace is fully initialized.

#### Option A. Check if the layout is ready

```ts
class MyPlugin extends Plugin {
    onload(app: App) {
	    super(app);
        this.registerEvent(this.app.vault.on('create', this.onCreate, this));
    }

	onCreate() {
	    if (!this.app.workspace.layoutReady) {
	      // Workspace is still loading, do nothing
	      return;
	    }
		// ...
	}
}
```

#### Option B. Register the handler once the layout is ready

```ts
class MyPlugin extends Plugin {
    onload(app: App) {
	    super(app);
	    this.app.workspace.onLayoutReady(() => {
	        this.registerEvent(this.app.vault.on('create', this.onCreate, this));
	    });
    }

	onCreate() {
		// ...
	}
}
```
