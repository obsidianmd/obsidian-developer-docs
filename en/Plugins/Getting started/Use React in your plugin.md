In this guide, you'll configure your plugin to use [React](https://react.dev/). It assumes that you already have a plugin with a [[Views|custom view]] that you want to convert to use React.

While you don't need to use a separate framework to build a plugin, there are a few reasons why you'd want to use React:

- You have existing experience of React and want to use a familiar technology.
- You have existing React components that you want to reuse in your plugin.
- Your plugin requires complex state management or other features that can be cumbersome to implement with regular [[HTML elements]].

## Configure your plugin

1. Add React to your plugin dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install react react-dom
   ```

2. Add type definitions for React:

   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev @types/react @types/react-dom
   ```

3. In `tsconfig.json`, enable JSX support on the `compilerOptions` object:

   ```ts
   {
     "compilerOptions": {
       "jsx": "preserve"
     }
   }
   ```

## Create a React component

Create a new file called `ReactView.tsx` in the plugin root directory, with the following content:

```tsx title="ReactView.tsx"
export const ReactView = () => {
  return <h4>Hello, React!</h4>;
};
```

## Mount the React component

To use the React component, it needs to be mounted on a [[HTML elements]]. The following example mounts the `ReactView` component on the `this.containerEl.children[1]` element:

```tsx
import { StrictMode } from "react";
import { ItemView, WorkspaceLeaf } from "obsidian";
import { Root, createRoot } from "react-dom/client";
import { ReactView } from "./ReactView";

const VIEW_TYPE_EXAMPLE = "example-view";

class ExampleView extends ItemView {
	root: Root | null = null;

	constructor(leaf: WorkspaceLeaf) {
		super(leaf);
	}

	getViewType() {
		return VIEW_TYPE_EXAMPLE;
	}

	getDisplayText() {
		return "Example view";
	}

	async onOpen() {
		this.root = createRoot(this.containerEl.children[1]);
		this.root.render(
			<StrictMode>
				<ReactView />,
			</StrictMode>,
		);
	}

	async onClose() {
		this.root?.unmount();
	}
}
```

For more information on `createRoot` and `unmount()`, refer to the documentation on [ReactDOM](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/client/createRoot#root-render).

You can mount your React component on any `HTMLElement`, for example [[Plugins/User interface/Status bar|status bar items]]. Just make sure to clean up properly by calling `this.root.unmount()` when you're done.

## Create an App context

If you want to access the [[Reference/TypeScript API/App/App|App]] object from one of your React components, you need to pass it as a dependency. As your plugin grows, even though you're only using the `App` object in a few places, you start passing it through the whole component tree.

Another alternative is to create a React context for the app to make it globally available to all components inside your React view.

1. Use `createContext()` to create a new app context.

   ```tsx title="context.ts"
   import { createContext } from "react";
   import { App } from "obsidian";

   export const AppContext = createContext<App | undefined>(undefined);
   ```

2. Wrap the `ReactView` with a context provider and pass the app as the value.

   ```tsx title="view.tsx"
   this.root = createRoot(this.containerEl.children[1]);
   this.root.render(
     <AppContext.Provider value={this.app}>
       <ReactView />
     </AppContext.Provider>
   );
   ```

3. Create a custom hook to make it easier to use the context in your components.

   ```tsx title="hooks.ts"
   import { useContext } from "react";
   import { AppContext } from "./context";

   export const useApp = (): App | undefined => {
     return useContext(AppContext);
   };
   ```

4. Use the hook in any React component within `ReactView` to access the app.

   ```tsx title="ReactView.tsx"
   import { useApp } from "./hooks";

   export const ReactView = () => {
     const { vault } = useApp();

     return <h4>{vault.getName()}</h4>;
   };
   ```
