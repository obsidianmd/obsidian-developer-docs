> Although we proposed some ways below to maintain and improvement your vault, likely the user of your vault is you and only you. This is different from plugins and themes where we can make relatively more objective suggestions.

> So feel free to remove anything from the checklist that doesn't make sense to you and add your own items.

## Vault maintenance

- [ ] How well is your vault doing what it's supposed to do? (What is the purpose of your vault/notes? What measures might you use to judge how well it's working?) [^1]
- [ ] How quickly can you find notes you used one week ago?
- [ ] If your cat intentionally deleted all of your files, how recent is your backup?
- [ ] Do you need to document anything about your workflows? It can be surprisingly helpful to write out how you work and create checklists for important but uncommon tasks.

## Vault maintenance checklist

- [ ] Delete unused attachments
- [ ] Delete or refactor notes that are not linked or tagged or in a folder ("orphan" notes)
- [ ] Delete unused tags
- [ ] Delete empty folders
- [ ] Process items in inbox notes/folders/tags
- [ ] Make templates for frequently-used snippets or note types
- [ ] Remove unused plugins
- [ ] Remove unused themes
- [ ] Remove unused snippets
- [ ] Add properties missing from notes
- [ ] Convert tags to properties where appropriate
- [ ] Fix up broken links
- [ ] Browse through the plugin gallery for new ideas

## Vault rediscovery ideas

- [ ] Open both Backlinks and Outgoing Links to see if there are any unlinked mentions that make sense
- [ ] Sort the files in Files Explorer by "Modified time (old to new)", take a look at the top files and see how they can be made better.
- [ ] Enable the Random Note core plugin and randomly visit some notes for surprises.
