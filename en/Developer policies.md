Our goal for community plugins and themes is to make it easy for users to safely modify and expand the capabilities of Obsidian while prioritizing private and offline usage.

All community plugins and themes added to the Obsidian directory must respect the following policies. Every plugin and theme is individually vetted before being included in the directory. Plugins and themes that don't follow these policies will be removed from the directory.

## Policies

### Not allowed

Plugins and themes must not:

- Obfuscate code to hide its purpose.
- Insert dynamic ads that are loaded over the internet.
- Insert static ads outside a plugin’s interface.
- Include client-side telemetry.
- Themes may not load assets from the network. To bundle an asset, see [[Embed fonts and images in your theme|this guide]].

### Disclosures

The following are only allowed if indicated in your README:

- Payment is required for full access.
- An account is required for full access.
- Network use. Clearly explain which remote services are used and why they're needed.
- Accessing files outside of Obsidian vaults. Clearly explain why this is needed.
- Static ads, including banners and pop-up messages within the plugin's interface.
- Server-side telemetry. A link to a privacy policy that explains how the data is handled must be included.
- Close-sourced code. This will be handled on a case-by-case basis.

### Copyright and licensing

All community plugins and themes must follow these requirements:

- Include a [LICENSE file](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-a-license-to-a-repository) and clearly indicate your plugin's license or theme.
- Comply with the original licenses of any code your plugin or theme uses, including attribution in the README if required.
- Respect Obsidian's trademark policy. Don't use the "Obsidian" trademark in a way that could confuse users into thinking your plugin or theme is a first-party creation.

## Reporting violations

If you encounter a plugin or theme that violates the policies above, please inform the developer by opening a GitHub issue in their repository. Kindly check existing issues to see if it’s already been reported.

[Contact the Obsidian team](https://help.obsidian.md/Help+and+support#Report+a+security+issue) if the developer doesn’t respond after seven days. For serious violations, you can contact our team immediately.

## Removing plugins and themes

In case of a policy violation, we may contact the developer and provide a reasonable timeframe for them to resolve the problem.

If the problem isn't resolved by then, we'll remove plugins or themes from our directory.

We may immediately remove a plugin or theme if:

- The plugin or theme appears to be malicious.
- The developer is uncooperative.
- This is a repeated violation.

In addition, we may also remove plugins or themes that have become unmaintained or severely broken.
